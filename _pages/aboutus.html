    <h1><strong>About the Golden Trowel Project</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-weight:600; max-width:70ch;">
      The Golden Trowel Project is a collaborative effort to make fieldwork safer, more ethical, and more inclusive across the sciences and humanities.</h2> 
<br>
<p>We compile practical tools, legal references, and survivor-centered resources to help researchers build environments rooted in consent and accountability.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      We believe that excellent research begins with safety and respect. 
      The Golden Trowel Project provides accessible, evidence-based resources 
      to help individuals and institutions strengthen their culture of consent, 
      prevent misconduct, and respond effectively when harm occurs.

      <h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The Golden Trowel Project grew from conversations among researchers, students, and fieldworkers who saw a need for 
        practical, accessible safety tools. The project’s content is curated by academics and advocates dedicated to survivor-informed practice. 
        While it began in anthropology, the site welcomes input from all disciplines conducting fieldwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is currently maintained by <em>volunteer contributors</em> who collaborate on open-access safety guides, 
        templates, and outreach initiatives. We welcome suggestions, corrections, and shared experiences that can improve accuracy and impact.

      <h3><strong>Our Core Values</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Every participant and collaborator deserves clear, informed, and voluntary agreement in all aspects of research.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Fieldwork should protect physical, emotional, and professional well-being — not put it at risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We share verified information about laws, reporting options, and institutional policies so no one has to navigate alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Safer fieldwork is inclusive fieldwork — centering marginalized voices and lived experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> Change happens when we share knowledge and support one another across disciplines and borders.</li>

<!-- 4) About the Name -->
<section class="section">
  <h2 class="pillhead pill--slate pill--clip-right">About the Name</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p>The <em>Golden Trowel</em> has a history in archaeology as a satirical metaphor, most famously used by Kent Flannery (1982) 
    to critique academic work that was elegant in theory but disconnected from the messy realities of fieldwork. 
    In that sense, the “golden trowel” symbolized prestige and perfectionism — often at the expense of practice and substance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The <strong>Golden Trowel Project</strong> reclaims this imagery with a new purpose. For us, the “golden trowel” represents 
    an aspirational ideal of fieldwork done well — not only rigorous in method, but also rooted in consent, safety, and equity. 
    True excellence in research comes not from prestige or flawless theory, but from creating environments where all researchers 
    can do their work without harassment, coercion, or harm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In short, we transform the old metaphor of the “golden trowel” into a call for a better standard: 
    <strong>safe, ethical, and inclusive fieldwork.</strong></p>
