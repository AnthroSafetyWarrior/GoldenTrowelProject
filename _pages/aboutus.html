<p>The <em>Golden Trowel</em> has a history in archaeology as a satirical metaphor, most famously used by Kent Flannery to critique academic work that was elegant in theory but disconnected from the messy realities of fieldwork. In that sense, the “golden trowel” symbolized prestige and perfectionism — often at the expense of practice and substance.

The <strong>Golden Trowel Project</strong> reclaims this imagery with a new purpose. For us, the “golden trowel” represents an aspirational ideal of fieldwork done well — not only rigorous in method, but also rooted in consent, safety, and equity. True excellence in research comes not from prestige or flawless theory, but from creating environments where all researchers can do their work without harassment, coercion, or harm.

In short, we transform the old metaphor of the “golden trowel” into a call for a better standard: <strong>safe, ethical, and inclusive fieldwork.</strong></p>
