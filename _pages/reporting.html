    <h1><strong>Reporting Misconduct and Safety Incidents</strong></h1>
<br>
    <h2 style="font-weight:600;">
      Reporting is how you document harm, get support, and help prevent future incidents. This page walks you through who to contact, how to record what happened, and what to expect—whether you’re in the field, abroad, or back at your home institution.

      <p><strong>Do this first (as needed):</strong></p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Get to safety / call emergency services.</strong> If abroad, contact your <em>embassy or consulate</em> for urgent assistance and safe transport.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek medical care.</strong> Hospitals/clinics can treat injuries, provide STI/HIV prophylaxis and emergency contraception, and—where available—offer forensic exams.
          <br><small>Tip: If possible, bring clothing in a paper bag; avoid washing if you may want evidence collected. You can decline any step.</small>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Connect with an advocate.</strong> Your <em>Title IX/Ethics office</em> or a confidential advocate can help with safety planning and accommodations. Reporting is your choice.</li>

        You can seek medical care and support without filing a report. 
        Document what you can (dates, times, locations, messages) only if it feels safe.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for safety accommodations (travel changes, extensions, housing).</li>
        <li>Bring a trusted person or advocate to any appointment.</li>

<!-- 3) DOCUMENTATION — pillband -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="pillhead pill--slate pill--clip-right">Documentation is Key</h2>

<div class="intro-title">
<p>Write down everything you remember as soon as you can—what happened, when, where, and who was present. Even small details can matter later.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have texts, emails, photos, or recordings, save and <strong>back them up</strong> in a secure place. When possible, share a copy with a <strong>trusted advocate, advisor, or Title IX contact</strong> so the record is protected even if your devices are lost or compromised.</p>
<br>
<p>You don’t have to decide about reporting now—documentation simply preserves your options.</p>

<section class="section">
  <h2 class="pillhead pill--sage pill--clip-left">Reporting to Local Law Enforcement</h2>

<div class="intro-title">
    <p><strong>You can choose whether to report.</strong> Laws and procedures vary by state, but many areas use Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) that coordinate medical care, forensic exams, and police response. You can ask police to notify your embassy or consulate for support.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>If you want to report:</strong> Try to report as soon as possible so evidence can be preserved. If you change clothes, keep what you were wearing in paper (not plastic). Save texts or messages and tell police if you think you were drugged. Ask for a copy or case number of the police report.</li>
      <li><strong>Forensic exam (“rape kit”):</strong> You may have an exam to preserve DNA and receive medical care. You do <em>not</em> have to report to get an exam, and you should not be billed for it. Minors may trigger mandatory reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>What happens next:</strong> Investigations and charging decisions are handled by prosecutors and may continue even if you later choose not to participate, depending on local law. Statutes of limitations for filing charges vary by state.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="lede-note" style="margin-top:.4rem; font-size:.95em;">
Procedures may differ depending on the country where you conduct research. Visit the <a href="{{ '/yourrights.html' | relative_url }}"><strong>Know Your Rights</strong></a> page, select your research country, and click the link under the “Reporting to Local Authorities” column for details.</p>	
    <p class="lede-note" style="margin-top:.4rem; font-size:.95em;">
      If you need confidential support or help locating an exam site, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline (RAINN): 800-656-HOPE (4673) or chat online at <a href="https://hotline.rainn.org">hotline.rainn.org</a>.

  <h2 class="pillhead pill--orange pill--clip-right">Reporting to Your Embassy or Consulate</h2>
 
 <div class="intro-title">
      <p>Consular staff can explain local procedures and connect you with resources. They can coordinate with police if you want to report and help with practical needs while you make decisions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>They can:</strong> link you to medical care; help replace a lost or stolen passport; contact family or your employer (with your consent); provide lists of lawyers; explain possible financial assistance to return to your country; and <strong>request updates from local authorities on your case</strong>; file a report on your behalf after you have safely left the country.</li>
        <li><strong>They cannot:</strong> investigate crimes, give legal advice or represent you, serve as official interpreters, or pay legal or medical costs.</li>
        <li><strong>How to find yours:</strong> Go to <a href="{{ '/yourrights.html' | relative_url }}"><strong>Know Your Rights</strong></a>, select your country of citizenship, and use the “Find My Local Embassy” link to open the directory for the country you’re currently in.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lede-note" style="margin-top:.4rem; font-size:.95em;">
        Information here is general and may change or be inaccurate depending on your country of citizenship—confirm details with the local embassy or consulate before you act.
