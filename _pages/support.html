      <h3><strong>Your choices, your pace</strong></h3>
      <p>
        You can seek medical care and support without filing a report. 
        Document what you can (dates, times, locations, messages) only if it feels safe.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for safety accommodations (travel changes, extensions, housing).</li>
        <li>Bring a trusted person or advocate to any appointment.</li>
        <li>You can stop or say no at any time.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <div class="text">
      <h3>Do this first (as needed):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Get to safety / call emergency services.</strong> If abroad, contact your <em>embassy or consulate</em> for urgent assistance and safe transport.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek medical care.</strong> Hospitals/clinics can treat injuries, provide STI/HIV prophylaxis and emergency contraception, and—where available—offer forensic exams.
<ul>
<li>Tip: If possible, bring clothing in a paper bag; avoid washing if you may want evidence collected. You can decline any step.</li></ul>
<li><strong>Execute your Fieldwork Safety Plan.</strong> If you're feeling overwhelmed, contact your emergency advocate and follow the steps outlined in your plan. You can also ask your designated emergency advocate or team contact to reach out to others on your behalf—sometimes that makes getting help easier and less overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Connect with an advocate or Title IX professional.</strong> If you’d prefer not to enact your Fieldwork Safety Plan, your institution’s Title IX or Ethics office includes trained professionals who can connect you with confidential advocates, safety planning, and supportive resources. They can also contact others or coordinate accommodations for you if that helps lessen the burden. Reporting remains your choice.</li>

    <h2>Finding the Right Support for You</h2>
    <p class="lede">You are in control of how you seek help. Understanding the difference between <strong>confidential</strong> and <strong>non-confidential</strong> resources can help you choose what feels safest and most supportive for your needs.</p>

    <!-- CONFIDENTIAL -->
      <h3><strong>Confidential Support</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Confidential resources do <em>not</em> share your name or details with others
        unless you give written permission or there is an immediate threat of harm to yourself or someone else.
        Speaking with them will <strong>not automatically start an investigation</strong> or formal report.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Campus or community <strong>advocacy centers</strong> (e.g., the Aurora Center, RAINN hotline, or local crisis centers)</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed mental-health professionals</strong> such as counselors, therapists, and psychologists</li>
        <li><strong>Medical providers</strong> (nurses, physicians, sexual-assault nurse examiners) who can provide treatment or evidence collection while keeping information private</li>
        <li><strong>Faith leaders or clergy</strong> acting in a pastoral-care role</li>
        <li><strong>24/7 confidential hotlines</strong> (e.g., National Sexual Assault Hotline 1-800-656-4673, National Domestic Violence Hotline 1-800-799-SAFE)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Confidential resources are often the best place to start if you want to talk through your options,
        receive emotional support, or explore reporting later on your own timeline.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- NON-CONFIDENTIAL -->
 <div class="col"> 
      <h3><strong>Non-Confidential Support</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Non-confidential (or “responsible”) resources are required to share certain information with others,
        such as campus Title IX or Ethics offices, or law enforcement. They exist to ensure safety and accountability,
        but your privacy may be limited once a report is made.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Title IX / Equity and Ethics Offices</strong> – usually required to take action once notified</li>
        <li><strong>Faculty, staff, teaching assistants, and supervisors</strong> who are designated as mandatory reporters</li>
        <li><strong>Campus security or police departments</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Human Resources offices</strong> for workplace incidents</li>
        <li><strong>Advocacy or awareness organizations</strong> like Take Back the Night – they are public and advocacy-focused, not confidential counseling services</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Non-confidential resources can help you file formal complaints, request accommodations,
        or pursue legal or disciplinary action. If you aren’t sure whether a resource must report,
        you can ask them before sharing personal details.

    <p class="lede">A quick checklist to help you choose the right resource and protect your privacy—especially if you’re abroad or using digital tools.</p>

<section class="section">
<div class="text">
    <h3>Before You Share Details, Ask:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality & reporting:</strong> “Are you a confidential resource? Under what circumstances would you share my information (e.g., minors, imminent harm, required by law)?”</li>
      <li><strong>Process & options:</strong> “What happens after I contact you? Will this start a formal report or investigation, or can I get information without reporting?”</li>
      <li><strong>Availability & coverage:</strong> “Are you available 24/7? Do you serve my location? If phone doesn’t work abroad, is there chat/email?”</li>
      <li><strong>Language & access (if needed):</strong> “Do you offer services in my language or interpreter support? Do you have accommodations for hearing/vision or other access needs?”</li>
      <li><strong>Data & privacy:</strong> “How is chat/text/email data stored? Is my IP or location logged? How can I stay anonymous if I prefer?”</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>Digital Safety Tips (use if helpful):</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a private/incognito window and consider a trusted device not shared with others.</li>
      <li>Clear recent tabs/history afterward, and disable message previews on your lock screen.</li>
      <li>If calling from abroad, U.S. toll-free numbers (e.g., 800/888) may not connect—try the organization’s online chat or local resources, or call via an embassy/consulate.</li>
