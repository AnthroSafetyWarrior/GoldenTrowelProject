    <h2 style="font-weight:600;">
      Empowerment begins long before the field. Building confidence in your ability to respond, set boundaries, and act under pressure is a form of preparation just as vital as packing your gear.
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Empowerment Self-Defense (ESD) training has been shown to significantly increase people’s ability to recognize danger, assert boundaries, and take action in moments when they might otherwise freeze or shut down. These skills are especially powerful for those who identify with the <em>flight or freeze</em> response, offering practical tools to move from fear to control.</p>
<br>
    <p>Practicing self-defense and boundary setting helps you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognize and interrupt unsafe situations early.</li>
      <li>Communicate and enforce your boundaries clearly and confidently.</li>
      <li>Respond with physical or verbal strategies that fit your comfort and capacity.</li>
      <li>Support others in distress through bystander intervention skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Learning these skills isn’t about expecting harm — it’s about reclaiming your agency. The more you practice identifying and asserting your boundaries, the more power you have to shape your safety, your comfort, and your fieldwork experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Empowerment Self-Defense (ESD)</strong> is a skills-based approach to safety that blends
        <em>awareness, boundary-setting, verbal strategies, and simple physical options</em>.
        ESD starts from the premise that you have power—and you can use it.</p>

      <p>Research on ESD programs shows increased confidence, clearer boundary-setting, and more effective responding under stress.
        These tools are especially helpful if you tend to <em>flight</em> or <em>freeze</em>; training offers concrete ways to
        notice early cues, choose a response, and act.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recognize earlier.</strong> Notice red flags and grooming tactics sooner.</li>
        <li><strong>State boundaries.</strong> Short, direct language that you practice in your own voice.</li>
        <li><strong>Act if needed.</strong> Accessible, high-percentage physical options matched to your capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Support others.</strong> Bystander skills that center consent and safety.</li>
      </ul>

<p><strong>How to Find Resources for ESD Training</strong></p>
      <ul>
 <li>Search for local ESD instructors or organizations (look for “trauma-informed,” “ESD,” or “IMPACT/Prepare”).</li>
<li>Check your university: campus rec, wellness, or Title IX offices often host free/low-cost ESD workshops.</li>
<li>Ask community centers, crisis resource orgs, or martial arts gyms about <em>empowerment-based</em> classes.</li>
<li>If cost is a barrier, request sliding-scale or scholarship options—many programs offer them.</li>
