        <li><strong>They cannot:</strong> investigate crimes, give legal advice or represent you, serve as official interpreters, or pay legal or medical costs.</li>
        <li><strong>How to find yours:</strong> Go to <a href="{{ '/yourrights.html' | relative_url }}"><strong>Know Your Rights</strong></a>, select your country of citizenship, and use the “Find My Local Embassy” link to open the directory for the country you’re currently in.</li>
