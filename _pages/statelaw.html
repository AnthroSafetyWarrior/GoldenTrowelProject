<h2>Know Your Defensive and Offensive Documentation Rights by State</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">This resource provides state-by-state information about laws related to recording, consent for audio, legal documentation rights, and other relevant protections during fieldwork.</p>
</div>

<div class="disclaimer">
<strong>Non-Citizen Protection:</strong> While definitions of consent, sex crimes, and the legality of recording in public or private spaces vary by state, these laws apply to <em>everyone</em>, including non-citizens. Federal laws, such as Title IX on campuses and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), provide baseline protections nationwide, but it remains essential to understand the specific laws of the state where you will be conducting fieldwork.
</div>

<div class="oneparty-caveat" role="region" aria-labelledby="opc-caveats-title">
  <h3 id="opc-caveats-title">Important Caveat to One-Party Consent States</h3>

  <p>Even in states where one-party consent is the general rule, the law often includes a key limitation: if the conversation takes place in a setting where there is a “reasonable expectation of privacy”, all-party consent may be required.</p>

  <p>This expectation of privacy can apply even in publicly funded or accessible spaces—such as a professor’s office, a museum curator’s lab, or a research space—if the circumstances suggest the conversation is intended to be private (e.g., closed doors, no other people present).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>In these situations, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the privacy expectation by changing the context:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep the door open:</strong> Clearly state at the outset that the door should stay open to indicate the discussion isn’t private.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to a public space:</strong> Some language you can use:
      <ul>
        <li>“I need to move my body, can we walk and talk?”</li>
        <li>“Let’s meet over coffee—there’s a local shop nearby.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t attend 1‑on‑1 meetings in private spaces while conducting fieldwork for my safety. I’m really looking forward to discussing [topic]—can we take this conversation to [public space]?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<br>
 <p><em>Each state’s laws are complex. Seek legal counsel to confirm current law and build a safety plan that fits your situation.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="disclaimer">
  <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is not an exhaustive or authoritative legal resource. Laws are subject to change. While the website publishers endeavor to update these resources when applicable, you should still contact university legal services or a qualified legal advisor to confirm the most current regulations before conducting fieldwork.
