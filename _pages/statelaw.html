<h2>Know Your Defensive and Offensive Documentation Rights by State</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">This resource provides state-by-state information about laws related to recording, consent for audio, legal documentation rights, and other relevant protections during fieldwork.</p>
</div>

<div class="oneparty-caveat" role="region" aria-labelledby="opc-caveats-title">
  <h3 id="opc-caveats-title">Important Caveat to One-Party Consent States</h3>

  <p>Even in states where one-party consent is the general rule, the law often includes a key limitation: if the conversation takes place in a setting where there is a “reasonable expectation of privacy”, all-party consent may be required.</p>

  <p>This expectation of privacy can apply even in publicly funded or accessible spaces—such as a professor’s office, a museum curator’s lab, or a research space—if the circumstances suggest the conversation is intended to be private (e.g., closed doors, no other people present).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>In these situations, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the privacy expectation by changing the context:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep the door open:</strong> Clearly state at the outset that the door should stay open to indicate the discussion isn’t private.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to a public space:</strong> Some language you can use:
      <ul>
        <li>“I need to move my body, can we walk and talk?”</li>
        <li>“Let’s meet over coffee—there’s a local shop nearby.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t attend 1‑on‑1 meetings in private spaces while conducting fieldwork for my safety. I’m really looking forward to discussing [topic]—can we take this conversation to [public space]?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<br>
 <p><em>Each state’s laws are complex. Seek legal counsel to confirm current law and build a safety plan that fits your situation.</em></p>
