<h1>Know Your Defensive and Offensive Documentation Rights by State</h1>
<p>This resource provides state-by-state information about laws related to recording, consent for photographs/videos/audio, legal documentation rights, and other relevant protections during fieldwork.</p>
</div>

<div class="oneparty-caveat" role="region" aria-labelledby="opc-caveats-title">
  <h3 id="opc-caveats-title">Important Caveats to One-Party Consent States</h3>
  <p>
    Even in states where one-party consent is the general rule, the law often includes a key limitation:
    if the conversation takes place in a setting where there is a “reasonable expectation of privacy,”
    all-party consent may be required.
  </p>
  <p>
    This expectation of privacy can apply even in publicly funded or accessible spaces—such as a professor’s office,
    a museum curator’s lab, or a research space—if the circumstances suggest the conversation is intended to be private
    (e.g., closed doors, no other people present).
  </p>
  <br><p><strong>In these situations, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the privacy expectation by changing the context:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep the door open:</strong> Clearly state at the outset that the door should stay open to indicate the discussion isn’t private.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to a public space:</strong> Some language you can use:
      <ul>
        <li>“I need to move my body, can we walk and talk?”</li>
        <li>“Let’s meet over coffee—there’s a local shop nearby.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t attend 1-on-1 meetings in private spaces while conducting fieldwork for my safety. I’m really looking forward to discussing [topic]—can we take this conversation to [public space]?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><p><em>Each state’s laws are complex. Seek legal counsel to confirm current law and build a safety plan that fits your situation.</em></p>
