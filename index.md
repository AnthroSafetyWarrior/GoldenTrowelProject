        This project was built from urgency — to make fieldwork safer for ourselves, our students, and our colleagues.
        It offers accessible, customizable tools to help researchers prevent and report sexual misconduct and other forms of behavioral harm during field research.
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot protect our science without protecting the people who do it. Safety begins with accountability:
        clearly stated expectations, transparent reporting systems, and a shared commitment to safeguarding not just our data, but each other.
        We are researchers, educators, and students — and we deserve to work in environments built on dignity, consent, and respect.

    A growing body of research suggests that training in boundary-setting and self-defense is not just reactive — it can <strong>shift how we respond under threat</strong>. For example,</p> 
<ul>
<li>empowerment self-defense (ESD) programs have demonstrated increased assertiveness, reduced fear in risky environments, and stronger self-protective decision-making <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221082734">(Beaujolais, 2023; </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.33043/SSWJ.2.1.63-76">Follo, 2022).</a></li>
<li>Other efforts in trauma prevention and rape-resistance place such training within evidence-based prevention strategies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10926771.2022.2046224">(Basile, 2022).</a></li></ul>
<p>These suggest that when we practice setting boundaries and preparing responses in advance, we may be less likely to default to appeasement or freeze patterns in moments of threat.
